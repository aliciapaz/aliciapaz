### Hi there, I'm aliciapaz ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy learning new technologies and languages.
I'm currently working on my programming skills to become a remote full-stack developer.

[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=anuraghazra)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

Looking for opportunities to contribute in open-source projects related to 
- ðŸ”­ education technology
-  :musical_note: music & arts
-  :herb: sustainability. 

Do you have a cool project that involves one or more of these topics?
