### Hi there, I'm aliciapaz ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy learning new technologies and languages.
I'm currently working on my programming skills to become a remote full-stack developer.

Looking for opportunities to contribute in open-source projects related to: 
- ðŸ”­ education technology
-  :musical_note: music & arts
-  :herb: sustainability

If you have a cool project that involves one or more of these topics, reach me on [Twitter]( https://twitter.com/_alicia_paz).
